# Memento - Meme organizer
Organize your memes by having the window to:

- Fix the meme orientation
- Fetching the OCR from the meme and renaming the particular image with the initial 60 characters 
- Option to track all text from the image and store in `/OCR-text/`
- Using OpenCV to segment Image and text to get the recognized text to edit the meme and store in `/Memento/`

**Currently in beta state**

**Note:**
Make sure you have a OCR tool like `tesseract` and certain data value for comparing OCR, eg `tesseract-data-eng` along with `Pillow` and `Wand` for image conversion and loading to draw along with `numpy` and `cv2` for all Image processing required to crop the image with border values defined
